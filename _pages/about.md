I received a B.S. and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Jilin University (JLU), Changchun, China, in 2017 and 2023, respectively. My Ph.D advisor is [Prof. Xiaohui Wei](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19686.htm). I have been a Visiting Student in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), mentored by [Prof. Tony Q.S. Quek](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/), in 2022. I have been a postdoctoral research fellow with Dalian Maritime University (DMU), Dalian, China, from 2023 to 2025, collaborating with [Prof. Hongbo Liu](https://www.scholat.com/liuhongbo). Currently, I am a lecturer with the College of Artificial Intelligence, Dalian Maritime University.

My research interest includes edge intelligence, federated learning, distributed computing, and crowdsensing.
