I received a B.S. and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Jilin University (JLU), Changchun, China, in 2017 and 2023, respectively. My Ph.D advisor is [Prof. Xiaohui Wei](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19686.htm). I have been a Visiting Student in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), mentored by Prof. Tony Q.S. Quek, in 2022. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Dalian Maritime University (DMU). My research interests include mobile crowdsensing, federated learning, and edge computing.

My research interest includes mobile crowdsensing, federated learning, and edge computing.
